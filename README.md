# landing-page-project

## Project Description:

For my second Project in the Udacity Program I made a landing page that used Javascript to create a Navigation bar. For each section, a nav menu item was created. I used a click event listener and the scrollTo method so when you click on a menu item, it's job is to scroll smoothly to the section.
